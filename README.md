# about

My name is David Mondello, and I like researching, designing, and building things. At present, Iâ€™m pursuing graduate work in the department of Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE) at the University of Washington. This site features both professional and academic projects to which I have contributed. For a chronological ordering of events, please consult my CV.
